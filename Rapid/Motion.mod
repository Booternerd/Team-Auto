        ! 'MoveJ' executes a joint motion towards a robtarget. This is used to move the robot quickly from one point to another when that 
        !   movement does not need to be in a straight line.
        ! 'pTableHome' is a robtarget defined in system module. The exact location of this on the table has been provided to you.
        ! 'v100' is a speeddata variable, and defines how fast the robot should move. The numbers is the speed in mm/sec, in this case 100mm/sec.
        ! 'fine' is a zonedata variable, and defines how close the robot should move to a point before executing its next command. 
        !   'fine' means very close, other values such as 'z10' or 'z50', will move within 10mm and 50mm respectively before executing the next command.
        ! 'tSCup' is a tooldata variable. This has been defined in a system module, and represents the tip of the suction cup, telling the robot that we
        !   want to move this point to the specified robtarget. Please be careful about what tool you use, as using the incorrect tool will result in
        !   the robot not moving where you would expect it to. Generally you should be using
